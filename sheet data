Steps:

1. Open your file in Notepad++.


2. Press Ctrl + H to bring up the "Find and Replace" window.


3. In the "Find what" field, enter the following regex pattern:

(<a[^>]*\bid="[^"]*)[!_]+([^"]*")

This pattern finds any occurrence of ! or _ within the id attribute of an <a> tag.


4. In the "Replace with" field, use:

\1\2


5. Ensure "Regular Expression" mode is selected at the bottom of the window.


6. Click "Replace All" to remove !_ from all anchor tag IDs in the document.



Explanation:

(<a[^>]*\bid="[^"]*): Matches the start of the <a> tag and everything up to the id value before the ! or _.

[!_]+: Matches one or more occurrences of ! or _ in the id.

([^"]*"): Captures the rest of the id value after the !_.


By replacing with \1\2, you effectively remove the !_ characters but keep the rest of the ID intact.
